# Hey, glad you're here!
I have a solid background in technology and programming, acquired through practical projects and diverse experiences. As a scholarship student in the Nikkei Community's Future Generation Training Program, I spent a month in Japan on an educational and sociocultural exchange, which provided me with unique adaptation and communication skills in multicultural environments. In addition, I took part in a voluntary research project focused on the classification of cardiac arrhythmias and ischemia from electrocardiograms, where I developed my analytical and technical skills.

In this page you'll projects that I participated or developed as a side project.
